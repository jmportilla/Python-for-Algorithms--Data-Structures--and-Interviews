    "** Given a list of integers, write a function that will return a list, in which for each index the element will be the product of all the integers except for the element at that index **\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example, an input of [1,2,3,4] would return [24,12,8,6] by performing [2×3×4,1×3×4,1×2×4,1×2×3] **\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "** You can not use division in your answer! Meaning you can't simply multiply all the numbers and then divide by eahc element for each index!**\n",

    "If you look at the list above with the multiplication you'll notice we are repeating multiplications, such as 2 times 3 or 3 times 4 for multiple entries in the new list. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll want to take a greedy approach and keep track of these results for later re-use at other indices. We'll also need to think about what if a number is zero!\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the products of all the integers (except for the integer at that index) we will actually go through our list twice in a greedy fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the first pass we will get the products of all the integers **before** each index, and then on the second pass we will go **backwards** to get the products of all the integers after each index.\n",
