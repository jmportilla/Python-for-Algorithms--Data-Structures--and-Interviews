    "You are in a hallway next to three light switches, all of which are off. Each switch activates a different *incandescent* light bulb in the room at the end of the hall. You cannot see the lights from where the switches are. Your task is to determine which light corresponds to each switch. However, you may go into the room with the lights only once.\n",
