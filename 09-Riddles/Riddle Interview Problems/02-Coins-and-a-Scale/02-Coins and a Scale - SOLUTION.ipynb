    "# Coins and a Scale - SOLUTION\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You have eight coins and a two-pan scale. All the coins weigh the same, **except for one** which is heavier than all the others. The coins are otherwise indistinguishable. You may make no assumptions about how much heavier the heavy coin is. What is the minimum number of weighings needed to be certain of identifying the heavy coin?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by dividing the coins into two groups of three, which you put on the scale, and one group of two, which you leave off. If the two sides weigh the same, the heavy coin is in the group of two, and you can find it with one more weighing, for a total of two weighings. On the other hand, if either side of the scale is heavier, the heavy coin must be in that group of three. You can eliminate all the other coins, and place one coin from this group on either side of the scale, leaving the third coin aside. If one side is heavier, it contains the heavy coin; if neither side is heavier, the heavy coin is the one you didnâ€™t place on the scale. This is also a total of two weighings, so you can always find the heavy coin in a group of eight using two weighings."
