    "Given the root of a binary search tree and 2 numbers min and max, trim the tree such that all the numbers in the new tree are between min and max (inclusive). The resulting tree should still be a valid binary search tree. So, if we get this tree as input:\n",

    "and we’re given **min value as 5** and **max value as 13**, then the resulting binary search tree should be: \n",
