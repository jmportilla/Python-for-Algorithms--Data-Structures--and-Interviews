    "# Introduction to Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will go over the basics of Recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main instances of recursion. The first is when recursion is used as a technique in which a function makes one or more calls to itself. The second is when a data structure uses smaller instances of the exact same type of data structure when it represents itself. Both of these instances are use cases of recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion actually occurs in the real world, such as fractal patterns seen in plants!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion provides a powerful alternative for performing repetitions of tasks in which a loop is not ideal. Most modern programming languages support recursion and recursion serves as a great tool for building out particular data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start this introduction with an example of recursion- a factorial function.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Factorial Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the lecture we will explain recursion through an example excercise of creating the factorial function.\n",
    "The factorial function is denoted with an exclamation point and is defined as the product of the integers from 1 to *n*. Formally, we can state this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ n! = n·(n-1)·(n-2)... 3·2·1 $$"

   "source": [
    "Take this example:\n",
    "$$4! = 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 24. $$\n",
    "So how can we state this in a recursive manner? This is where the concept of **base case** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base case** is a key part of understanding recursion, especially when it comes to having to solve interview problems dealing with recursion. Let's rewrite the above equation 4! so it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 4! = 4 · (3 · 2 · 1) = 24 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this is the same as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 4! = 4 · 3! = 24 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning we can rewrite the formal recursion definition in terms of recursion like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ eq here$$\n",
